## Background

In our company, we have a lot of Slack workSpaces.

In addition, we also post an attendance to Slack, but it's a bit of a hassle to post everything to all the different workSpaces.

Then, it seems that we can solve this problem by using Slack API and mutual posting, but I heard that some WorkSpace prohibits external linkage for security reasons. What the heck...

So, if we take a screenshot of the secure Slack and post it to the Slack we usually use, at least we've communicated, so it'll be easy! So let's make it.

### Architects

Use Lambda in VPC to create a Lambda with a fixed global IP address, and push the Docker Image to the ECR.

Also, for security reasons, the login password to Slack will be encrypted using AWS KMS.
